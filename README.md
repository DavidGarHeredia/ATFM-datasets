# ATFM instances

Code to generate instances for the Air Traffic Flow Management Problem.

This code was used to generate the data for the paper:

Garc√≠a-Heredia, D., Molina, E., Laguna, M., & Alonso-Ayuso, A. (2021). A solution method for the shared resource-constrained multi-shortest path problem. Expert Systems with Applications, 182, 115193. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115193

Please, open the notebook file (ATFM.ipynb) for details about dependencies and how to run the code.
